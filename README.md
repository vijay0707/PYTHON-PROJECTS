# PYTHON-PROJECTS
Python projects for both beginners and intermediates

## INTRODUCTION
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. 
Python has been in the top 10 popular programming languages for a long time, as the community of Python programmers has grown a lot due to its easy syntax and library support.

Here, I'll introduce to you amazing python projects with source code and also some resources to learn python.
